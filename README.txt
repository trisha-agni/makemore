Description: In this project I have implemented a character-level language model.

What I learned:

Python:
- The lambda function can be used to sort the bigrams based on number of occurrence.
- enumerate(): iterate an index with the list item
- zip(): combine multiple iterables into a single iterable of tuples.
- Libraries:
  - Torch
    - Used to create a 2D array containing counts of the bigrams
    - Tensors

Math:
- 

AI:
- Special start and end characters (add more later)
